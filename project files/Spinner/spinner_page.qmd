## Project Overview
For this project, the goal was to design a fidget spinner using SolidWorks that would be able to house bearings in it. From that CAD file we created an FEA analysis, machined a mold of the CAD file, and finally used injection to create the actual fidget spinner that we had designed.

## Skills Demonstrated
* CAD Modeling
* FEA Analysis
* Machining
* Injection Molding

## Steps
1. Create a model of the proposed spinner body and the bearing caps to go with it

2. Create a model of the mold

3. Create an FEA analysis assuming that the spinner was dropped from 2 meters

4. Machine the mold (*at this point the group voted on a design to all use, hence the change in design from hereon in*)

5. Use an injection to create the spinner, and input the bearings
