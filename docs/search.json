    "text": "Introduction\nEvery year on February 2nd Punxsutawney Phil, a groundhog, comes out and looks around to see if he can see his shadow. If he sees his shadow, the prediction is that there will be another six weeks of winter that year; if he doesn’t see his shadow, the prediction is that there will be an early spring that year. While this has been a tradition in the United States going back to 1887, the objective of this work is to see if there is any true correlation between Punxsutawney Phil seeing his shadow and the weather following that event. This will allow us to see if it is statistically significant whether Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow or not, and what we might be able to expect from the weather based on that data."

    "text": "Methods\nTo find the information regarding whether Punxsutawney saw his shadow or not, I used data collected by the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club.The information about weather comes from NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center, where they measure temperature in different regions of the United States and average them together per month. To create the inferential statistic, there were two null hypotheses formed, based on whether Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow or not. If he saw his shadow, the null hypothesis was that the mean temperature of the following month would be equal to or greater than the mean temperature of every year combined for the month. The alternative was that the mean would be lower than the total mean of all the data. If he didn’t see his shadow, the null hypothesis was that the mean temperature of the following month would be equal to or less than the mean temperature of every year combined for the month. The alternative was that the mean would be greater than the total mean of all the data. This was a way of measuring whether it really would continue to be winter if he saw his shadow, and if there really would be an early spring if he didn’t see his shadow. From there the hypotheses were tested using a double sample hypothesis test in Python, using the Scipy package scipy.stats.ttest_ind()."

    "text": "Discussion\nIn the context of the original question, the p values show an interesting significance. If Punxsutawney Phil doesn’t see his shadow, thereby predicting a continued winter, there is almost a 30% chance the average temperature of the next month will be greater than the total average, putting it well above a 5% significance level. However, if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow and predicts an early spring, there is only a 0.92% chance that the average temperature of the next month will be less than the total average, meaning it is statistically significant and we can reject the null hypothesis. Thus, we conclude that it is not statistically significant if Punxsutawney predicts a continued winter (p= 0.2906), but it is significant if he predicts an early spring (p= 0.0092).\nView the complete report here"

These diagrams account for the force of gravity, the normal force, aerodynamic drag (\\(F_d\\)), and rolling friction (\\(F_r\\)). Using the free-body and corresponding kinetic diagrams, we derived the equations of motion by applying Newton’s second law in the direction of motion.\n\nAfter deriving the necessary equations, we followed these steps:\n\nNumerical Integration: Converted the second-order equations into a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), solved using Python’s scipy.integrate.odeint.\nParameter Optimization: Performed a manual iterative fit of the drag coefficient \\(C_d\\) and the coefficient of kinetic friction \\(k\\) to align the simulated velocity curves with experimental “North” and “South” data sets.\nSensitivity Analysis: Conducted uncertainty quantification by introducing a \\(\\pm 5\\%\\) variation in final velocity (\\(v_f\\)) to establish confidence intervals for our fitted parameters."

In contrast, the rolling friction coefficient \\(k\\) exerts a near-constant effect and is more significant at lower speeds.\nBecause of this, the effects of \\(C_d\\) and \\(k\\) can be distinguished by examining how quickly velocity drops early in the coast versus how it behaves near the end. However, there is still some flexibility—it is possible to slightly increase one parameter while decreasing the other and still achieve a visually similar fit. This limits the precision with which either parameter can be determined individually, a trade-off we quantified through our confidence interval analysis.\nView the complete report here"

A Python implementation using solve_ivp in SciPy solved the SIR differential equations. To estimate the optimal β and γ parameters, a mean squared error function compared model predictions to actual data. A grid search over arrays of β and γ values, the ranges taken from online research of what common values were, produced a 2D error matrix, visualized using a contour plot (Figure 1). The global minimum in this matrix identified the β and γ values that best fit the observed data. The results of the models predictions were then graphed over top the actual collected data over the course of the year. This same graph was also used to show how expected peak times and maximum intake number at hospitals would change based off of changed assumed constants(Figure 2)."

As illustrated in the results, the optimized model closely tracks the peak and duration of the infection curves. The effectiveness of the model relied heavily on the optimization of the transmission rate (β) and recovery rate (Ɣ). The use of a Mean Squared Error (MSE) function allowed for the quantification of fit quality, and the generation of a contour map confirmed the existence of a global minimum. This suggests that for a specific strain and location, distinct and constant values for transmissibility and recovery can reasonably approximate the complex dynamics of a flu season, and this could be used in a predictive manner to help hospitals know when and how to prepare around flu season.\nView the complete report here"
